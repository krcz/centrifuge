This repository uses `AGENTS.md` for agent instructions. You must treat `AGENTS.md` exactly like `CLAUDE.md`. 

**Subdirectories**: Before editing or reading files in a subdirectory, check if an `AGENTS.md` exists in that subdirectory. If it does, read it first to update your context.
**Priority**: Treat instructions in `AGENTS.md` as binding system rules.
